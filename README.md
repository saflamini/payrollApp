This application allows groups to pay employees in crypto.

It has yet to be deployed on a blockchain, and is still undergoing testing.

Contracts - solidity code that includes functionality to:
-create, read, update, and delete employees
-fund the contract for future payroll disbursements
-pay employees

Src - front end code that allows users to interact with contracts.
-This code will be regularly improved, and will likely include authentication in the future.

This project is in development.

Future roadmap: 
1) Create front end application to interact with our solidity code.
2) Create functionality to auto-pay employees based on a chosen, pre-set interval (not just weekly, bi-weekly, etc). Ideally this is decentralized and uses a Chainlink oracle.
3) Support stablecoin payments - likely with Celo or USDC.
